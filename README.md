# A5-Project-Analyzing-Boston-Fire-Department-Incident-Reporting-Harshil

Problem Definition:

The research question explored was: What patterns and trends can be identified in the incident reporting data from the Boston Fire Department?

Methodology:

Data Collection:
The data was sourced from the Boston Fire Department’s open data platform, which included details of fire incidents such as date, location, type, and response times.

Data Cleaning:
The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information. This included standardizing date formats and filtering out non-fire-related incidents.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Various techniques such as summary statistics, visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps), and trend analysis were employed to understand the data distribution and identify patterns. Key focus areas included:

Temporal trends: Analyzing incident frequency over different time periods (daily, monthly, yearly).
Geographic distribution: Mapping incidents to understand spatial patterns and high-risk areas.
Incident types: Categorizing and analyzing different types of incidents to determine common causes and frequency.
Insights and Recommendations:

Temporal Insights: Identified peak times for incidents, which were predominantly in the evening hours and during winter months.
Geographic Insights: Certain neighborhoods had consistently higher incident rates, indicating the need for targeted fire safety programs.
Incident Type Analysis: Common incidents included residential fires, which suggested a focus on home safety education and regulations.
Conclusion:
The analysis provided actionable insights for the Boston Fire Department to optimize resource allocation, enhance community safety programs, and improve overall response strategies. These findings were summarized in a comprehensive report with visual aids to support the recommendations. ​​
